This is a tool for streamers to help display information about your wonders, policies, and religion in Civ 5.
You can get the latest version at https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/civ5tracker/releases (click to download the latest
zip file that does not have "source code" in the name)

It must be used in conjunction with the "Export Info" mod, available at
https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/civ5exportinfo

Start a game with the mod active at least once before you run this program.

It puts info in the text files in its "output files/" folder. You can overlay them on your stream using OBS.
